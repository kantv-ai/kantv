I'm learning and practing AI tech by study the source codes of ggml as an independent programmer although parts of them(the real/hardcore AI tech) are really hard to understand quickly. This is not the most important difficult problem for this project.


The most important difficult problem for this project is the <b>big interference</b> of GFW: a paid proxy must be used for reliable access to github.com and huggingface.

I hope there is no GFW in my country in the future although I can not see that day is coming.
